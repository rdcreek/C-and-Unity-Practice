This is a program I wrote to complete an assignment for a Coursera course.  The code simulates drawing cards from a deck,
placing them into a hand, and then it counts the number of cards of each suit.  

I find it pretty funny that most of the lines of code are for the autograder.  The assignment only required me to write a few lines of code. 

I initialized variables for each suit, wrote a for loop to draw cards and put them into a list (the hand), and then used a foreach loop to 
increment up the values of the suit variables.  After that, I just had to print out the values of each variable with the correct formatting for
the autograder.
